ABOUT:

The objective is to redesign our home page using Bootstrap. To do this, we create style classes inside the Style element within the HTML file. 

We'll also need to implement an interactive feature to our home page using Java Script. We will call on the DOM inside our JS file that will allow us to make changes to our HTML content.

==========================================================

DAILIES:

(2/24)

- found a simpler implementation of accordion style on w3schools; applied it to the 'Skills' section of my home page. Just nested my existing content inside of that button element. 
- inserted the "Try it Out" code from w3schools into its own html file (for later reference); file name == v2.html
- updated README file; created like a backlog to track anything I think could be made better or anything that is still left to do


(3/17)

- removed jumbotron section; was no longer necessary since text info is now incorporated into image
- added second accordion to hold all info related to Business skills
++++++++++++++++++++++++++




==========================================================

ROOM_FOR_IMPROVEMENT:

(General)
- Need to offset each section by the height of the fixed navigation bar. I think this is what's causing the page to scroll past the expected starting point
- Would like to do something with the 'Contact' section, besides the default grey. Would also like to do something to differentiate it from the main content on the home page; it shouldn't be as prominent. 
- Get graphics from Canva.com to use as thumbnails in the 'Projects' section. Then need to link each to the corresponding repo on Git Hub
- Add actual copy to the 'About' section
- Add something additional to the 'Welcome' section, just an introduction
- Add additional sub-sections in the 'Skills' section using the Accordion style; add Business, Finance, etc. (see drawing of that layout)
- update color scheme of the #accordion style

(Blog)
- Say something simple in the Overview part of your 'Blog' section
- Write blog post #2 as reflection of this assignment; link it to the HTML file. Follow the formatting from blog post #1; should be consistent
- add short summary on home page for blog post #2
- add short summary on home page for blog post #1
